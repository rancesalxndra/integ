  <h2>SKILLS</h2>
  <p><blockquote><blockquote>The capability of a person to be successful in certain things is only achievable through patience and striving for hard work, which defines the skills of a person. Alexandra’s skills involve a lot of time to build especially since she had a difficult time working on her self-esteem. Starting from her communication skills, I am capable of interacting and verbalizing my thoughts eloquently especially when I’m with the people I am really close to. Through this certain skill, I developed better cooperation skills in terms of working with others particularly in school group projects. Furthermore, I maintained good relationships with my friends and family members through benefitting this certain skill. Solving problems for my own good and to others is also one of my skills, as an individual. These problems can be emotionally draining for most parts, however, solving them is a huge relief. Next skill is being able to adapt to every situation I face. It may involve a difficult time to adjust and adapt to environments and situations I have never been to but it is the first step in building an indispensable skill of an individual. Adaptability leads to being flexible to stressful situations since you have experienced it before and the difference is nothing compared to what you have experienced in the first place. Through adaptability, I am able to develop critical thinking skills despite given circumstances. Lastly, determination and persistence are the crucial skills I have developed for the betterment of myself. It is one of the factors of being successful and not to give up immediately no matter how difficult times are.

   <br>
   Having personal skills and being better at them means that you have become successful in focusing on what is best for you, you continue to improve for more and strive on goals despite the circumstances brought to you.</blockquote></blockquote></p>

   <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
   <p><blockquote><blockquote>Life is an excitement when you have hobbies; we acquire this ever since we were in our childhood years. However, it may drift apart from us when we have reached a certain point in life when we have become too caught up in work or in school or in life. During my childhood years, I acquired dancing as my main hobby. The synchronization between the music and the movement of my body when I was a child up to being a teenager made me lighthearted. It also made me realize, at that time, that I could become a professional dancer when I grow up. Gardening also became one of my hobbies since I participated in school and environmental activities during my elementary and junior high school years. I enjoyed planting the seed and covering it with soil despite that it was a tedious and dirty process. When I started senior high school, writing became one of my best hobbies. Whether writing a story or a research paper or anything that involves writing, I gradually adored taking notes or forming sentences in paragraphs to express my thoughts. As I compose my thoughts, I listen to music contributing to developing another hobby of mine. Being excited whenever I explore and discover new singers and genres makes me feel like I am on cloud nine. Every rhythm and beat that I have a liking for, I memorize every lyric of that song until it becomes one of my favorite songs. Hobbies are what makes an individual as themselves.

   <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
   <p><blockquote><blockquote>Being familiar with oneself is a gratifying feeling, especially when you know your interests. Since you know your interests, it strengthens your capability and emotional well-being to do things and become confidently bold to achieve your dreams and goals. Learning a new language is considered as one of my best interests. It would benefit me to understand new cultures outside of my country and interact with locals in countries I would be interested in visiting. Another interest of mine is rhythm & blues and classic music, aiding me whenever I get way too stressed out in life. During my elementary to high school years, I was very interested in English and History subjects. My interests in these aforementioned subjects led me to being involved in creative writing and documentaries, obtaining also interests in them. I thought to myself that as soon as I learn what my interests are, it would make me become a more confident person and would not be completely persuaded or succumbed to negative consequences of not  being able to fully know what you really are.</blockquote></blockquote></p>
