  <h2>WHY COPENHAGEN...</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high school student, I was a huge fan of football specifically Neymar Jr. I enjoy watching him play, competing against Réal Madrid. Since Neymar Jr. was born in Brazil, I considered Brazil to be a good dream place to visit since my high school years. I would love to experience a good swim to their beaches while socializing to locals and learn their culture and Spanish language. Rio de Janeiro is a city of festivals and shanty towns that I would love to experience and see in an first-person point of view. I would love to have a picture standing below the Christ the Redeemer statue in Mount Corcovado. The atmosphe in Brazil is considered lively and I would love to experience it someday.</p>
