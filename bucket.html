	<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I reach the point in my life where I stop worrying about what others think of me, I will achieve all the things that I want. My bucket list consists of future achievements and mostly things that will gratify my future and child self.</p>
	
	<br><ol class="list">
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride in a hot air balloon or attend at least five hot air balloon festivals across the globe. When I watched the movie 'Tangled' during my elementary school years and saw the scene focusing on hot air balloons, I instantly added it to my bucket list ever since then.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel to Korea and have a picture of certain locations of my favorite Kdrama scenes. I enjoy watching Kdrama so it would be an achievement to witness the locations in person. </li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch an NBA or Football game live, hopefully I get to watch my favorite Basketball and Football team.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn at least three foreign languages, specifically Italian, Spanish, and French. I am very much interested in learning new languages as it is an advantage when it comes to learning cultures of different countries and I think it would personally help me to improve my memory skills and socialization skills.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more than 10 books in a year. Every summer, when there is no school work to keep me busy I intend to read books to stimulate my mind and stay off of my phone. It keeps me sane and improves my vocabulary. </li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donate and support charities of my choice every year. I believe that if you have been given a sufficient amount of funds, you should donate it to people in need. </li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swim on a beach or in open water. Since I was a child, I was scared to swim even in a swimming pool. Now, I’ve conquered my fear to swim in a swimming pool yet on a beach or in open water. </li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plant more trees and participate in nature activities. I like nature and I would do everything that I can to save it. </li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build a freelance business and learn finance technology or anything about finance. It would mean so much to my future self if I started investing and become literate in finance technology.</li>
	
	<br>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a personal achievement of becoming independent. Sometimes, I tend to be dependent on my close friends and loved ones and I think it is not healthy so at most, I should try to live my life as my own and not become totally dependent on others. </li>
