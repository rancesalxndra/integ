  <h2>WHY PARIS...</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living the Parisian life, I would love to visit and stay in Paris for a week to experience the fun of being in a place where people would not mind others' businesses while still continuing to thrive in their fashionable outfits. The architecture of Paris has an elegant style that lends itself to casual strolling or biking while wearing a good trench coat or a good North Face puffer jacket. I would love to experience eating a croissant in one of their lovely cafés while drinking coffee and reading a book. I would love to experience their nightlife or watch the Eiffel Tower from afar flashing lights during the night. Some would say that Paris is considered one of the dirtiest places to visit, but it would still be a lovely experience to see the city of love from a tourist's perspective.</p>
