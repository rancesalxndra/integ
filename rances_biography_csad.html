    <div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout these significant years, I have spent my entire childhood life in several places and points of life contributing to my present years up to my future state<sup>1</sup>. I was born in San Juan Metro Manila and born on <b>June 19, 2003</b><sup>2</sup>. I have three siblings and I am the youngest<sup>3</sup>. The Alexandra in her childhood years was childish and nonchalant about certain things in life, not knowing what lies ahead in retrospect<sup>4</sup>. Growing up, my siblings and our mother were separated due to financial problems and lived in a religious children welfare institution for about four or five years together with my older sister<sup>5</sup>. For years, I have spent my childhood participating in recreational activities like gardening and playing with other children during afternoons<sup>6</sup>. As I vaguely remember my childhood years, my older sister and I spent mornings greeting sisters or priests and actively participated in church by serving in masses<sup>7</sup>. I went to a catholic elementary school in Manila and was especially interested in subjects English and Araling Panlipunan<sup>8</sup>. I was also a fan of playing sports like Volleyball, Badminton, and a little bit of Basketball<sup>9</sup>. Developing also hobbies of dancing and a little bit of acting during class presentations<sup>10</sup>. Back then, my family, friends, and classmates called me by my nickname <cite>Mhi</cite><sup>11</sup>. I used to be passionate about the future and always changed my future dream job depending on what I see from television series or movies: from being a nurse, to being part of an army, to becoming a pilot, or to be a great detective<sup>12</sup>. Since my mother and other siblings were not present at all times during my childhood, my sister and I took care of each other until present times<sup>13</sup>. Looking back to Alexandra’s childhood years, she was energetic at all times<sup>14</sup>. Greeting every person she encounters every day, always with a smile<sup>15</sup>. I remember when I was at the age of nine years old, a typical zestful child, I went swinging to extremity while looking up at the sky which caused my head to hit the cement tiled outdoor floor<sup>16</sup>. The nine-year old Alexandra began to laugh while crying due to headache from the swing accident<sup>17</sup>. Another accident that happened during my childhood years was when a nun from the institution instructed my sister and I to shred papers in their office as a pastime for us before lunch, the energetic and heedless Alexandra curiously had her hand in the shredder machine<sup>18</sup>. The misfortunes that occurred in my childhood years served as a guide for my teenage years to present that I should think twice about everything that I would think in doing<sup>19</sup>. During my childhood years, the bond that I have shared with my elementary to high school classmates have been irreplaceable and incomparable<sup>20</sup>. Alexandra’s childhood years were a glimpse from the past as a means of nurturing and enlightenment for Alexandra’s approaching adulthood<sup>21</sup>.</p>

    <div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Alexandra’s teenage years were approaching, her attitudes and behaviors were also changing<sup>1</sup>. The energetic and passionate Alexandra in her childhood years was inconspicuous during these specific years, hidden away since shyness and nervousness in interacting with people first came up to her subconsciousness<sup>2</sup>. Teenage years for me were my junior high to senior high school years<sup>3</sup>. During these years, my mother, my sister and I got back together<sup>4</sup>. We would go on trips together for weeks<sup>5</sup>. Every weekend night, the three of us would always go on a movie night and eat out at our favorite restaurants after<sup>6</sup>. At school, my elementary friends were also my junior high friends so I became familiar with interacting with the same faces that I see daily during school days<sup>7</sup>. In my eighth to ninth grade, my mother decided to get a dog<sup>8</sup>. Since people at home were busy, I unconsciously took care of that dog to the point that it became my beloved pet<sup>9</sup>. My pet’s name was <i>Patpat</i> and he was a golden retriever labrador breed, always staying by my side through ups and downs<sup>10</sup>. Patpat became my best friend and also sometimes like a child<sup>11</sup>. Then my mother decided to adopt five more dogs, making our home like a shelter for dogs<sup>12</sup>. My last two years in junior high school were the best years of my high school life, attending proms and partying after in hotel rooms.<sup>13</sup> As I approached the final year of junior high school, I was influenced by drinking with my friends and I thought it was a good thing since I was living in the moment back then<sup>14</sup>. After tenth grade, it was summer and I suffered from depression<sup>15</sup>. No one knew about it since I didn’t know back then that it was that <i>thing</i><sup>16</sup>. My elementary to junior high school friends moved from different schools while I remained in the same school for senior high<sup>17</sup>. The depressing feeling of being familiar with certain people through years and suddenly not seeing them daily made me suffer from anxiety in approaching and making friends with my senior high classmates<sup>18</sup>. Eventually, I made new friends while I was content from the comfort of my pet when I went home after school<sup>19</sup>. Until my dog died during my grade eleven years, I didn’t know what to feel back then and the depressing feeling lingered on me as I approached the final year of senior high school<sup>20</sup>. Then, the pandemic happened<sup>21</sup>. I’ve met new faces again in my 12th grade<sup>22</sup>.I built romantic relationships but somehow didn’t feel content<sup>23</sup>. Alexandra’s teenage years were lethargically different from her childhood years, suffering from hidden emotions of sadness and at the same time the euphoric feeling was somehow still discernible<sup>24</sup>.</p>

    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandra’s first year college experience happened in light of the pandemic, limited social interaction and being confined at home was the main source of entertainment<sup>1</sup>. The feeling of emptiness surrounded her still while continuing her studies<sup>2</sup>. Meeting new people has been one of the highlights of my ongoing college years<sup>3</sup>. Being in college, I thought it was just like being in senior high school<sup>4</sup>. Until I reached second year in college, the amount of school tasks would dominate over my personal problems<sup>5</sup>. At home, financial problems arise due to the repercussions brought by the pandemic<sup>6</sup>. Having a huge amount of responsibilities at home while wanting to perform well in college made my self destructible but at the same time made me strive for more<sup>7</sup>. The beliefs that I built during my childhood years collapsed as I struggled to overcome day-to-day challenges<sup>8</sup>. I no longer attend masses in church anymore since the pandemic happened<sup>9</sup>. My alcohol drinking habit engulfed my lifestyle<sup>10</sup>. My optimistic self during my childhood to teenage years was replaced by gloom<sup>11</sup>. Despite all the situations that I’ve encountered,  my grades did not disappoint me<sup>12</sup>. As I entered college, I thought to myself that four years would fly fast and I would not submit to negative influences<sup>13</sup>. Now that I’m in second year, currently studying in the second semester of the school year, face-to-face or hybrid classes were implemented<sup>14</sup>. Since then, I started to restore faith in myself and began to start attending masses in St. Jude every Thursday and Quiapo church every Friday again<sup>15</sup>. However, influences would consume my system again<sup>16</sup>. My high school friends supported me all the way, even though they also have their own personal challenges <sup>17</sup>. Attempting to build courage and optimism in my college years brought me to certain realizations in life that would contribute to becoming my best self again and in my future endeavors<sup>18</sup>. The Alexandra in her college years may suffer from her personal difficulties in life, but she continues to strive and thrive<sup>19</sup>. I would always think to myself that there’s always something good coming and that I should keep going to achieve in becoming my better self<sup>20</sup>. </p>
