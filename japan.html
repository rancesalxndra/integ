  <h2>WHY OSAKA AND TOKYO...</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy streets of Tokyo and Osaka in Japan made me contemplate to visit the mentioned cities someday. Since I love ramen and most Japanese foods, I would love to experience the fun of being in Japan and take a picture beside the Sakura tree and dress up like their traditional clothing while posing at Osaka Castle or Shitennoji Temple. The people in Japan are also great in wearing fashionable outfits, I consider it as an inspiration and I would love to explore the streets of fashion. I would also love to casually stroll at their night markets filled with healthy and delicious dishes since it would suffice my happiness in visiting the place. </p>
