  <h2>WHY COPENHAGEN...</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark. It is surrounded by the coastal islands of Zealand and Amager. It is my priority place to visit someday since I consider it a calm and serene atmosphere. I would love to spend my afternoons in their sidewalk cafes and flea markets or experience their street parties. Since Copenhagen is considered the best bike city, I would love to explore the place while riding a bike. I think it would calm my emotional state while I navigate the streets of Copenhagen, watch the sunset in a different time zone, and meet new people. Also, I love the architectural design of the place, especially the tourist spot Nyhavn. The Tivoli Gardens would be a great place to unwind and relax while reading my favorite book and also watching other people's activities on their own. </p>
